Background: 

Mobile healthcare delivery is an innovative model of health services delivery that provides a wide variety of services to vulnerable populations. These clinics vary in service mix, patient demographics, and relationships with the fixed health system (Malone et al., 2020) Although access to care has increased in recent years through the Affordable Care Act, barriers continue to persist, particularly among populations living in resource-limited areas. The largest demographic utilizing mobile health van services have Medicaid (Song et al., 2013)



Problem/Hypothesis:

Health disparities are a prevalent issue in the United States and Mobile Health Vans are productive ways to provide care for these populations. But how many of these clinics exist per state? Mobile clinics can improve access by serving as a vital link between the community and clinical facilities (Malone et al., 2020). Therefore, it is important to look at the correlation between Medicaid enrollment and the prevalence of mobile health clinics to see if states with high rates of Medicaid enrollment also have high amounts of mobile health clinics to address these populations. 



Point of Action:

First, I analyzed a large data set (HRSA) of federally funded clinics in the US. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is a US government agency. The HRSA dataset contains all federally funded clinics in the US. Not all clinics are Mobile Vans. So, I specifically queried and counted the mobile health clinics per state and visualized their data to see the amount and spread of mobile health clinics in the USA. Next, the amount of Medicaid enrollments per state will be queried and visualized as well. This Medicaid dataset is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data from January 2023 was used as it is recent and timely in relation to the current date.
